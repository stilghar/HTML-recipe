    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>
    <p style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">So, I have been terribly sick this last week.  Coughing, runny nose, sneezing, an aversion to anything that involves getting up, the whole shebang.  So, one day when I was particularly hungry, I found the energy to make up some rice porridge.  In Japan, rice porridge is the equivalent of chicken noodle soup when you’re sick.  As such, if a person has just fallen sick with a cold or a fever in an anime or manga (SKET Dance included), chances are a friend will rush over and make them a pot of hot rice porridge.  So if you’re ever feeling like you might be getting sick, call up a friend and hand this recipe to them, or, if you’re feeling cooped up at home and hungry, make it for yourself!</p><br>
